# Cloze-test-with-BERT

This repository contains a collection of experiments about fine-tuning different **BERT** models to perform cloze text tasks. The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of transformer architectures and the process of fine-tuning pre-trained models.

Task: complete a sentence that has had a word removed choosing between two given alternatives.



Please note again that this repository is not intended to be state-of-the-art. Rather, it's a personal exploration and attempt to improve my understanding of deep learning networks, particularly transformer architectures and fine-tuning processes.
